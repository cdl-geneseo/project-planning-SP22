# Geneseo Tempestry
Below are some of my ideas regarding the Geneseo Tempestry, the project that I plan on helping out with this semester! When Amanda first mentioned this new group that she was forming, I immediately knew that I wanted to be involved with it -- whether that be attending meetings as a general member, or helping out behind the scenes. I think that this project is especially relevant in current times, as climate change and global warming seem to only worsen year after year. I also think it is super interesting how this project takes statistical data and transforms it into something tangible; this idea seems to perfectly fit the description of what we mean when we talk about practicing digital pedagogy.

## Tempestry over time
I think it would be cool to do would be some sort of photo documention of the tempestry over time, perhaps on a monthly or seasonal basis. That way, we have a visual of how the tempestry has progressed; since this is the first/"pilot" semester for the tempestry, it would be interesting to start taking note of how things are coming along. It would also offer a basis of what worked and what did not, which might prove to be useful if the tempestry is to continue in years to come.

## Tempestry blog

#### *When I want to get to know new people, I talk to them about climate change... I find that it's a good icebreaker.*

Moreover, I think that integrating a blog section into the tempestry website would really drive that community aspect of the group home. The original idea I had was to include roundtable discussion posts -- say we select a particular question or topic to discuss at every other meeting or so, of which members can respond to however they would like. For example, one of the questions Amanda and I were curious to hear different responses about was what crafting (whether in a general sense or in regard to a specific craft) truly *means* to people. Is it something that they simply enjoy and practice for fun, or does it run deeper than that? How can we share that same passion with others? For me personally, many of my family members are artists who specialize in various forms of media, from painting, to photography, to quilting; I have never known a life that did not revolve around art, but I know that this may not be the same for some people. Another question we had concerned *why* exactly crochet has become popular again in the past year or so, especially among Gen Z. Has it become a stress reliever after the world being on lockdown for longer than anyone anticipated, or have social media platforms such as TikTok made it trendy? Alternatively, possibly preparing a topic about a current environmental issue in advance [(such as microplastics becoming increasingly common in the ocean)](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/science/ocean-plastic-animals.html) could give members some time to do their own research and come to the meetings with any thoughts they may have about what is going on. I think that blog posts could be formed from these discussions in two ways -- either a quick summary of what was talked about at the meetings afterwards done by one or two people, or, members could maybe publish their own blog posts through OpenLab. The latter option would require a lot of extra work and preparation, but it might be more rewarding for those who may be interested in doing so. 

## Data Collection/Management
I do not have much to say in this section, but I am more than willing to assist Amanda in collecting and organizing temperature data (using a script in Jupyter Notebook) for those who request specific years!

## Closing Thoughts
In brief, this is just a rough outline of what I would like to accomplish with the Geneseo Tempestry as my project for the Center for Digital Learning this semester. I am still unsure of the specifics of certain things, such as how I would want the blog to be formatted or how the posts would be constructed. Nonetheless, I am excited to see what I can do!

## (Loose) Action Plan

* Create a Ravelry group for Geneseo Tempestry
    * At our most recent meeting, Alexis had mentioned the site [Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/) to me. I recognized the name, but I had never used the platform myself. After browsing through it, though, I think that this would be a great way to keep track of Tempestry members' projects over the summer! You can create groups on there, in which members can talk over discussion boards and share photos of their recent work. I also like that within the group itself and members' individual profiles that you can link to outside websites, which I think is the perfect opportunity to link all of us back to the Geneseo Tempestry blog. *However*, I cannot figure out how to create a group on there -- so it may take some more research on my end to figure out how to do so.
