# Ideas for Project
There are a few different ideas that I have, and I am going to use this space as a way to express and explore each and every one of them. Internally I have a creative calling to one above the rest, but I bet you can't figure out what that one is ðŸ™ƒ


## Held In Common 
This project is one that I've been thinking about for the past couple months, and it is to build a simple app that digitally archives different material that a group of individuals might hold in common-- like books, art, or electronics. I want to make a space where people can potentially upload material that they would like to share with the group, and have a way that fosters the lending of these objects between these individuals. I also want to make it so when a person uploads a object, or submits one to be held in common, they might be able to place certain restrains on that object, like that it can only be held for 6 months, or that it can be kept longer, but it must be renewed and not be requested by other members of the common community.

## A Revised Understanding
What I see this project as being is a digital archieve or library of physical material-- pretty simple to understand. What is perhaps different about this concept is that instead of there being a central abiter of these material, it is instead distributed-- perhaps unequally-- amongst those individuals within the agreement. Within this structured agreement I see there being roles assigned to individuals within it. For some reason, as I am writing this, I am getting visions of the rousseauian tree of social contract...Anyway, while the ultimate goal is that these objects can be lended and shared amongst individuals, perhaps initial phases of this project will be the establishment of a shared collection. And before that the establishment of a single persons collection. 

### Phase 1 - Archive
The first steps towards achieving the goals of this project is to create a sort of digital archive of objects.

### Phase 2 - Interaction
In this phase I want to create a way for there to be users who have limited privilages, and can interact with the not neccesarily through commenting, but rather through developing its provenance. This feature would include users suggesting edits to the work of art
