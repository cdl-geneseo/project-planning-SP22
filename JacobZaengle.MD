# Ideas for Project
There are a few different ideas that I have, and I am going to use this space as a way to express and explore each and every one of them. Internally I have a creative calling to one above the rest, but I bet you can't figure out what that one is ðŸ™ƒ


## Held In Common
This project is one that I've been thinking about for the past couple months, and it is to build a simple app that digitally archives different material that a group of individuals might hold in common-- like books, art, or electronics. I want to make a space where people can potentially upload material that they would like to share with the group, and have a way that fosters the lending of these objects between these individuals. I also want to make it so when a person uploads a project, or submits one to be held in common, they might be able to place certain restrains on that object, like that it can only be held for 6 months, or that it can be kept longer, but it must be renewed and not be requested by other members of the common community.

## Digital Exhibition

I was recently talking with Dr. Levy about a program he is working on running this next summer which is meant to engage perspective students and young students interested in Philosophy. As part of this summer program they are planning on having students breaking up into groups and working on a colective project together that could be amassed into a sort of Digital Exhibition. In this exhibition space students will put together and express their research and work in a specific philosophic concept. What I am thinking, is that I should try and make a template for these students to potentially use to put together their differen't projects, and maybe talking with professor Myzlev about different digital exhibitions she has seen that were done well. I am not yet sure what all this would look like, or if it can really be modularly constructed to predict the uses or visions that students would have for this space.

## Bright Spot
This was a project that I spoke with Paul and Amanda about initially when looking for a project, and it revolved around ways that I could potentially help with the transition to brightspot. But, as we talked I realized that there were paid professionals working on this and that there probably wasn't much impactful help that I could add to this project.

The potential area that I could lend a hand in was adding a students perspective durring the faculty on boarding course that might add motivation for why certain practices should be adopted. I still like this idea, and do think adding a voice that is closer to home might help motivate some towards adopting certain practice and "see the light"

## Metaphyics Textbook
This is a project that my professor pointed my towards when expressed an interest in assisting 

The benefits for myself that I see this project providing are that in that it helps me develop skills in digital publishing, and it also would get me into reading works within philosophy that I have an interest in, and will most likely not get the chance to study while at geneseo.
