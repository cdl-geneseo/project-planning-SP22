<head> General Plan </head>
<body>
I'm hoping to make a lesson plan showing how to use Google MyMaps as an alterntive assesment in a middle school social studies classroom. This particuarl assesment will allow students felxibility in how they would like to demonstrate their knowledge, since they can write, find photos or videos, and altogether put together a creative final product. It will also assess and hel students develop key social studies skills, such as research, lateral reading, using sources in multiple modaltiies, and making connections. This is supposed to be a very broad lesson plan that can be used to assess any of the NYS units and will incorporate NYS Social Studies skills and Next Generation ELA sReading and Writing standards.

I'm planning on making this an interactive, web-based plan with examples of how to use and adapt the assesment for different goals, classrooms, and students. I plan on embedding examples and providing sample videos, handouts, and worksheets to be part of the assesment and to help students with the skills. I will also include justifications for the plan and explain what they assess and why. I will also include examples.

At this point I am not sure what the best format for this would be -- would I want it to be a website of sorts or some sort of hyperdoc? Both come with their own pros and cons, so I'll need to think further about it. I also need to make sure my focus is not way too broad and that it can actually serve as an alternate assesment for all units. Finally, I'll need to make sure that everything I put in their is approprate for the middle-school grade level, which I am becoming even more familiar with since I am currently subbing in a middle school.
